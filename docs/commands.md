Reference of all available esy commands. The most common commands are [`esy
install`](#esy-install) and [`esy build`](#esy-build).

List of all commands:

<AUTOGENERATED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS>

## Main commands

### `esy install`

Install dependencies declared in `package.json`:

```bash
% esy install
```

If file `esy.lock` (an analogue of `yarn.lock`) exists then it will be used to
resolve dependencies' version constraints to concrete versions, otherwise
constraints resolution will be performed and saved to a fresh `esy.lock`.

This command is based on `yarn` and accepts the same [command line arguments and
options](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/install/).

### `esy build`

Ensure all dependencies are built and then execute the project's build commands.
Note that esy tries to reuse built artifacts as much as possible, even across
different sandboxes. That means that usually `esy build` executes only the root
project's build process.

Example:

```bash
% esy build
```

## Run commands in the specified environment

These commands allow executing arbitrary commands in esy's managed
environments. For more info about environment types see the [corresponding
docs](environment.md).

### `esy build <anycommand>`

Run command `<anycommand>` in the build environment.

For example, we can see which `ocamlfind` libraries are available:

```bash
% esy build ocamlfind
```

Another example usage would be to execute a build process for some specific
build target:

```bash
% esy build bin/hello.exe
```

This is useful when you want to perform a build just for a subset of build
outputs.

### `esy build-shell [<path/to/package>]`

Initialize shell with build environment.

Example:

```bash
% esy build-shell
```

If a `<path/to/package>` argument is passed then the build shell is initialized for
the specified package:

```
% esy build-shell ./node_modules/@opam/lwt
```

This command is useful for debugging failing builds.

### `esy <anycommand>`

Run command `<anycommand>` in the command environment.

Example:

```bash
% esy vim ./bin/hello.re
```

As the command environment contains development time dependencies (like
`@opam/merlin`) `vim` program will have access to those.

### `esy shell`

Initialize shell with command environment.

Example:

```bash
% esy shell
```

### `esy x <anycommand>`

Execute command `<anycommand>` in the test environment.

Example:

```
% esy x hello
```

This invocation puts the root project's executables in `$PATH` thus it's useful to
test the project as if it were installed.

## Sandbox introspection

### `esy ls-libs`

Prints a dependency tree with all available libraries.

Example:

```bash
% esy ls-libs
```

### `esy ls-builds`

Prints a dependency tree with status of each package.

Example:

```bash
% esy ls-builds
```

### `esy build-env`

Prints build environment on stdout.

Example:

```bash
% esy build-env
```

### `esy command-env`

Prints command environment on stdout.

Example:

```bash
% esy command-env
```

## Other commands

### `esy add`

Adds a new dependency for a project.

Example:

```bash
% esy add @opam/lwt
```

This is an analogue of `yarn add` command and is based on it internally.

### `esy release <release-type>`

Produce an npm package with a release in `_export/<release-type>` directory. See
[Building Releases](release.md) for more info.

The required argument `<release-type>` must be one of:

* `dev`
* `pack`
* `bin`

Example:

```bash
% esy release bin
```

### `esy config`

Query esy configuration.

List all configuration parameters:

```bash
% esy config ls
```

Query specific keys:

```bash
% esy config get store-path
```

### `esy import-opam <pkg-name> <pkg-version> <path-to-opam-file>`

Import OPAM package metadata and produce corresponding esy metadata.

Example:

```bash
% esy import-opam lwt 3.0.0 ./lwt.opam > package.json
```

### `esy install-cache`

Manage installation cache. This command is based on `yarn install-cache`
command and accepts the same command line options.

### `esy export-dependencies`

Export dependencies of the root project from a build store.

Example:

```bash
% esy export-dependencies
```

The invocation above produces a set of tarballs inside the `_export` directory.
Those tarballs can be shipped to another host and imported into build store with the
`esy import-build` command.

### `esy export-build`

Export a single build out of a build store.

Example:

```bash
% esy export-build ~/.esy/3/i/ocaml-4.6.0-abcdef90
```

This commands produces `_export/ocaml-4.6.0-abcdef90.tar.gz` tarball which can
be imported into another build store with `esy import-build` command.

### `esy import-build`

Import a single build into a build store.

Import from a previously exported build:

```bash
% esy import-build ./_export/ocaml-4.6.0-abcdef90.tar.gz
```

Import from a build store:

```bash
% esy import-build /path/to/build/store/3/i/ocaml-4.6.0-abcdef90
```
